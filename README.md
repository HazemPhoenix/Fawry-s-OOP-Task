## Assumptions 
1. Product weights are in Kilogram.
2. 3 Biscuit flavors (Chocolate, Vanilla, Butter) but can be easily extended.
3. MobieScratchCard only provides internet data in GigaBytes.
4. 2 Sectors (Technology and Food) but can be easily extended.

## Design Considerations 
1. I realize that the design might have been an overkill, but i wanted to challenge myself and see how far i can take it.
2. Some classes might feel useless (e.g. the concrete cheese classes), but i have created them for the possibility of extension.
3. A lot of classes were not required in the task but i felt the need to add them for a complete design.
